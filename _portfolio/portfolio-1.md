excerpt: "<br/><img src='/images/tetris.png' width='200'><br/><br/>
[6.4212](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/Fall2022/) is a graduate class that focuses on creating robotic systems that can automatically manipulate physical objects in unstructured environments. For our final project, we developed TetrisBot: an end-to-end robotic system that plays Tetris. We developed the perception, control, and gameplay systems that Tetris requires using [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/). This project won the *Best Project Award* for Fall 2022.

title: "6.8610 Final Project: Predicting Metadata from Song Lyrics Using NLP"
excerpt: "<br/>
[6.8610](https://mit-6861.github.io/) is MIT's graduate NLP class. For our final project, we developed a method for automatically predicting song metadata (attributes such as danceability, energy, etc). Our algorithm shows high promise and is a step towards replacing Spotify's crowdsourced metadata system, which can be highly inaccurate and incomplete.
