title: "CAPSA: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Risk-Awareness"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/capsa.png' width='150' align='left' >
As part of my work at [Themis AI](https://themisai.io), I spearheaded the development of CAPSA, an open-source toolkit to automatically diagnose risk in ML models, regardless of the architecture or data modality. CAPSA can be used through a one-line addition to any training workflow. By leveraging shared feature backbones and composing risk metrics, we are able to achieve state of the art risk estimation in a more efficient and robust manner. Our paper, on which I am a co-first author, was published at the Robot Learning Workshop at NeurIPS '22.<br/>
