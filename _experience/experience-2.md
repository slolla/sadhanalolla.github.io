title: "6.8610 Final Project: Predicting Metadata from Song Lyrics Using NLP"
excerpt: "
[6.8610](https://mit-6861.github.io/) is MIT's graduate NLP class. For our final project, we developed a method for automatically predicting song metadata (attributes such as danceability, energy, etc). Our algorithm shows high promise and is a step towards replacing Spotify's crowdsourced metadata system, which can be highly inaccurate and incomplete. <br/>
