title: "6.869 Final Project: StyleAI: A Deep-Learning Powered Outfit Generator"
excerpt: "<img align='left' src='/images/styleai.png' width='200'>
[6.869](http://6.869.csail.mit.edu/sp22/) is MIT's graduate CV class. For our final project, we explored whether a model could 'learn' a sense of fashion. We did this by developing a novel contrastive learning approach to outfit generation, and found that outfits generated by the model were both plausible and creative. <br/>
