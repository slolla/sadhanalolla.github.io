I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at MIT majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics and literature. I am also a [Gates Cambridge scholar-elect](https://news.mit.edu/2024/sadhana-lolla-gates-cambridge-scholar-0227) and will spend the next year obtaining an MPhil in Technology Policy at the University of Cambridge.

My research focuses broadly on the application of deep learning to robotics and on designing and deploying uncertainty-aware artificial intelligence. I am currently working on input uncertainty quantification and propagation as an Undergraduate Research Intern at Microsoft Research with [Dr. Ava Amini](https://avaamini.com/). 

For the past two years, I have conducted research at the Distributed Robotics Laboratory with [Prof. Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Alexander Amini](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/), where my projects have ranged from debiasing autonomous vehicles to developing more generalizeable control policies for soft robotics. 

Previously, I've been fortunate to work as a Machine Learning Scientist at [Themis AI](https://themisai.io/). I've also interned at Google on the [Keras](https://keras.io/) team with [Francois Chollet](https://fchollet.com/), where I worked on accelerating distributed training, and the [Discover Ranking Team](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover), where I developed recommendation algorithms. I've also interned for Decisive Analytics, where I developed CV-based security systems for the air force, and have conducted research at George Washington University at the [Medical Imaging and Image Analysis Laboratory](https://loewlab.seas.gwu.edu/).

In addition to research, I have worked as an Analyst at [Safar Partners](https://www.safar.partners/), a venture capital firm that focuses on investing in early stage technology companies.

I'm also really passionate about teaching: I am an instructor and lead TA for [MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning Course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/), one of the most popular deep learning classes in the world. I also serve as the curriculum team lead for [Momentum AI](https://momentumai.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy [baking](https://www.instagram.com/lollabytes/), reading, and solving crosswords.
