I am a recent graduate of MIT, where I earned a B.S. in computer science with minors in mathematics and literature. I am also a [Gates Cambridge Scholar](https://news.mit.edu/2024/sadhana-lolla-gates-cambridge-scholar-0227) and will spend the next year obtaining an MPhil in Technology Policy at the University of Cambridge.

My research focuses broadly on the application of deep learning to robotics and on designing and deploying uncertainty-aware artificial intelligence. 

I have most recently worked on input uncertainty quantification and propagation as an Undergraduate Research Intern at Microsoft Research with [Dr. Ava Amini](https://avaamini.com/). 

Before that, I conducted research at the Distributed Robotics Laboratory with [Prof. Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Alexander Amini](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/), where my projects have ranged from debiasing autonomous vehicles to developing more generalizeable control policies for soft robotics. 

Previously, I've been fortunate to work at [Themis AI](https://themisai.io/) on uncertainty quantification in deep learning, [Google's Keras Team](https://keras.io/) on accelerating distributed training,  [Google's Discover Ranking Team](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover) on recommendation algorithms, and [Safar Partners](https://www.safar.partners/) on investing in artificial intelligence and robotics startups. 

Outside of research, I am an instructor and lead TA for [MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning Course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/), one of the most popular deep learning classes in the world. I have also served as the curriculum team lead for [Momentum AI](https://momentumai.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy [baking](https://www.instagram.com/lollabytes/), reading, and solving crosswords.
