I am a third-year undergraduate student at MIT majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. My research focuses broadly on the application of deep learning to robotics and on designing and deploying safe and trustworthy AI. I currently work at the Distributed Robotics Laboratory with [Prof. Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Alexander Amini](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/), and also as a Machine Learning Scientist at [Themis AI](https://themisai.io/). I am also an Analyst at [Safar Partners](https://www.safar.partners/), a venture capital firm that focuses on investing in early stage technology companies.

Previously, I've been fortunate to intern at Google on the [Keras](https://keras.io/) team with [Francois Chollet](https://fchollet.com/), where I worked on accelerating distributed training, and the [Discover Ranking Team](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover), where I developed recommendation algorithms. I've also interned for Decisive Analytics, where I developed CV-based security systems for the air force, and have conducted research at George Washington University at the [Medical Imaging and Image Analysis Laboratory](https://loewlab.seas.gwu.edu/).

This summer, I will be joining the Biomedical ML group at Microsoft Research, where I will be working as an Undergraduate Research intern with [Dr. Ava Amini](https://avaamini.com/).

In addition to research, I am an instructor for [MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning Course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/), one of the most popular classes at MIT. I also volunteer for [Momentum AI](https://momentumai.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy [baking](https://www.instagram.com/lollabytes/), reading, and solving crosswords.
